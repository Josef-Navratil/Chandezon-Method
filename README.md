# Chandezon-Method
Implementation of Chandezon Method for gratings with a differentiable profile\
To start run the file "C_Method_main.m"\
The parameters are loaded from the file "setParameters.m"\
Changing anything except the parameters in the file "setParameters.m" can seriously affect the functionality of the code\
The outcomes are graphs of diffraction efficiencies/ellipsometric parameters in the respective propagation orders\
The visualisation of intensity distribution is rather slow\
Despite the slowness rendered figures are cool :-).
