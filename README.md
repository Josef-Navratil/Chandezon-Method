# Chandezon-Method
Implementation of Chandezon Method for gratings with a differentiable profile

To start run the file "Chandezon_method.m"
The parameters are loaded from the file "setParameters.m"
Changing anything except the parameters in the file "setParameters.m" can seriously affect the functionality of the code
The outcomes are diffraction efficiencies in the respective propagation orders
The visualisation of intensity distribution is rather slow, choosing the wavelength outside the range will skip it
Despite the slowness redreded figures are cool :-).
